# Dataset
1. The dataset is `metaCDN Workload Traces`, specifically the `meta_reag.oracleGeneral.zst`
2. It is accesible through https://ftp.pdl.cmu.edu/pub/datasets/twemcacheWorkload/cacheDatasets/metaCDN
3. The dataset has been processed into a csv file, it is stored in this repository using git lfs
4. The dataset statistics detail can be viewed in [traceStat](https://github.com/Marthenn/prefetcher_transformer/blob/main/traceStat) generated by traceAnalyzer from [libCacheSim](https://github.com/1a1a11a/libCacheSim), with a quick glimpse of the details below in `dataset summary` section

## Dataset Summary
1. This dataset is traces of I/O in metaCDN environments
2. The dataset consists of `timestamp`, `obj_id`, `obj_size`, and `next_access_vtime`
3. In this task, we only use `timestamp` and `obj_id` since we are ignoring size for the transformer prefetching (it is deemed as unimportant for the task)

## Dataset Example
> Sample was taken using the head function from pandas
